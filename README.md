# HoneywellHome Binding

_This binding is used to connect your HoneywellHome (only T5/T6 thermostat for now) using official [HoneywellHome Api](https://developer.honeywellhome.com/api-methods)._ 

_The binding supports discovery via configuring your HoneywellHome dev App (describe down below)._ 

_From the binding, you will get status of your thermostat and also a command channel where you can control the thermostat._ 

_Since the binding uses a polling mechanism, there may be some latency depending on your setting regarding refresh time_
